# PIG-Game
Players take turns rolling a die; they can roll as many times as they like in an attempt to accumulate points. However, if they roll a 1, they lose all points accumulated in that turn. The first player to reach a specified score wins. This project includes functionalities for rolling dice, tracking scores, and determining the winner.
